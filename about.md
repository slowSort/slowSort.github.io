Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a digital nomad based out of Edinburgh, Scotland.

As a developer, I take pride in being a generalist. I love working on web based products big or small, and have spent the last five years mostly working with React and Node.js.

I'm currently the main developer at [AirManual](https://www.airmanual.co/). The last three features I built were a full-text document searcher, a GPT powered template creator, and a Grammarly style feedback provider for our document editor.

I hope you have some fun or learn something new from reading my blog. In fact, nothing would make me happier. ðŸ˜Š
