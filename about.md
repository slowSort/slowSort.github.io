Hey there! My name's Daniel 👋 and my favorite emoji is 🙇‍♂️ (at your service).

Edinburgh is my home, but since the pandemic, I've spent a lot of time traveling around, living out of a suitcase with my wife Abi. We're currently situated in Istanbul. 🇹🇷

Outside of work you'll most likely find me learning either Spanish (by trying not to cry laughing at Betty la fea) or Polish (by trying not to cry pronouncing Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz).

I love to read! Last year I read or listened to over 40 books in Polish and Spanish, if you're curious you can find my book list here.

The M. as my middle name stands for Maung, I'm half Scottish, half Burmese (all business). I started using it more often for a very serious reason and not at all when I realized that Samuel L. Jackson sounds way cooler than Samuel Jackson.

I hope you have some fun or learn something new from reading my blog. In fact, nothing would make me happier
